\caption{\textbf{Across-participant timepoint decoding accuracy varies with

    \textbf{a.-c.~Timepoint decoding accuracy as a function of order: PCA.} Order ($x$-axis) refers to the maximum order of dynamic
    correlations that were available to the classifiers (see
    Feature weighting and testing).  The reported
    across-participant decoding accuracies for \textbf{a. Gaussian},
    \textbf{b. Laplace}, and \textbf{c. Mexican hat} kernel shapes are averaged over all
   widths (see Identifying robust decoding
      results).  The $y$-values are displayed relative to chance
    accuracy (intact: $\frac{1}{300}$; paragraph: $\frac{1}{272}$;
    word: $\frac{1}{300}$; rest: $\frac{1}{400}$).  The error ribbons
    denote 95\% confidence intervals of the mean across cross-validation folds
    (i.e., random assignments of participants to the training and test
    sets).  The colors denote the experimental condition.  Arrows
    denote sets of features that yielded reliably higher (upward
    facing) or lower (downward facing) decoding accuracy than the mean
    of all other features (via a two-tailed $t$-test, thresholded at
    $p < 0.05$, exact values are reported in the Source Data file).  The circled values represent
    the maximum decoding accuracy within each experimental
    condition. Panels a.-c. used PCA to
    project each high-dimensional pattern of dynamic correlations onto
    a lower-dimensional space. \textbf{d.-f.~Timepoint decoding accuracy as a
      function of order: eigenvector centrality.} These panels are in the
    same format as Panel a.-c., but here eigenvector centrality has been
    used to project the high-dimensional patterns of dynamic
    correlations into lower-dimensional spaces. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.}

    between the vectorized upper triangles of the recovered
    first-order and second-order correlation matrices and the true
    (simulated) first-order and second order correlation matrices.
    The averages are taken across several randomly generated
    synthetic datasets for each timeseries pattern (constant, random,
    ramping, and data; see Synthetic data: simulating dynamic higher-order
      correlations).  The $x$-axes of each heatmap denote varying
    Laplace-shaped kernel widths (see Figs.~\ref{fig:supp_kernels}

    denote varying durations (in samples) of the synthetic datasets.
    A total of 10 synthetic datasets were generated for each duration
    (row) and timeseries pattern (panel).  Source data are provided as a Source Data file.}
