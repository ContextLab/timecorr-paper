\caption{\textbf{Across-participant timepoint decoding accuracy varies with

    \textbf{a.-c.~Timepoint decoding accuracy as a function of order: PCA.} Order ($x$-axis) refers to the maximum order of dynamic
    correlations that were available to the classifiers (see
    Feature weighting and testing).  The reported
    across-participant decoding accuracies for \textbf{a. Gaussian},
    \textbf{b. Laplace}, and \textbf{c. Mexican hat} kernel shapes are averaged over all
   widths (see Identifying robust decoding
      results).  The $y$-values are displayed relative to chance
    accuracy (intact: $\frac{1}{300}$; paragraph: $\frac{1}{272}$;
    word: $\frac{1}{300}$; rest: $\frac{1}{400}$).  The error ribbons
    denote 95\% confidence intervals across cross-validation folds
    (i.e., random assignments of participants to the training and test
    sets).  The colors denote the experimental condition.  Arrows
    denote sets of features that yielded reliably higher (upward
    facing) or lower (downward facing) decoding accuracy than the mean
    of all other features (via a two-tailed $t$-test, thresholded at
    $p < 0.05$).  The circled values represent
    the maximum decoding accuracy within each experimental
    condition. Panels a.-c. used PCA to
    project each high-dimensional pattern of dynamic correlations onto
    a lower-dimensional space. \textbf{d.-f.~Timepoint decoding accuracy as a
      function of order: eigenvector centrality.} These panels are in the
    same format as Panel a.-c., but here eigenvector centrality has been

    correlations into lower-dimensional spaces.}

    (simulated) first-order and second order correlation matrices.
    The averages are taken across several randomly generated

      correlations).  The $x$-axes of each heatmap denote varying
