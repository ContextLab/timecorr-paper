\caption{\textbf{Across-participant decoding accuracy varies with
      correlation order and cognitive engagement across kernels.}
    \textbf{a.-c.~Decoding accuracy as a function of order: PCA.} \textit{Order} ($x$-axis) refers to the maximum order of dynamic
    correlations that were available to the classifiers (see
    \textit{Feature weighting and testing}).  The reported
    across-participant decoding accuracies for \textbf{a. Gaussian},
    \textbf{b. Laplace}, and \textbf{c. Mexican hat} kernels are averaged over all
   widths (see \textit{Identifying robust decoding
      results}).  The $y$-values are displayed relative to chance
    accuracy (intact: $\frac{1}{300}$; paragraph: $\frac{1}{272}$;
    word: $\frac{1}{300}$; rest: $\frac{1}{400}$).  The error ribbons
    denote 95\% confidence intervals across cross-validation folds
    (i.e., random assignments of participants to the training and test
    sets).  The colors denote the experimental condition.  Arrows
    denote sets of features that yielded reliably higher (upwards
    facing) or lower (downward facing) decoding accuracy than the mean
    of all other features (via a two-tailed test, thresholded at
    $p < 0.05$).  The circled values represent
    the maximum decoding accuracy within each experimental
    condition. Panels a.-c. used PCA to
    project each high-dimensional pattern of dynamic correlations onto
    a lower-dimensional space. \textbf{d.-f.~Decoding accuracy as a
      function of order: eigenvector centrality.} This panel is in the
    same format as Panel a.-c., but here eigenvector centrality has been
    used to project the high-dimensional patterns of dynamic
    correlations onto a lower-dimensional space.}

\caption{\textbf{Top terms associated with the endpoints of the
    strongest correlations for the \textit{intact} experimental

functional correlations. The inflated brain plots display the
locations of the endpoints of the 10 strongest (absolute value)
correlations at each order, projected onto the cortical
surface~\citep{CombEtal19}.  The lists of terms display
the top 10 Neurosynth terms~\citep{RubiEtal17} decoded from the
corresponding brain maps for each order.  (Also see Fig.~\neurosynth,
